Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.\n\tIf you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see \"Improvised Weapons\").\n\nRange: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.\n\nLoading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\n\nReload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property.

        "description": "The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.\n\nSpecial: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.\n\nTwo-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.\n\nProficiency: martial, double-bladed scimitar\nSource:\tEberron: Rising from the Last War p. 21,\n\t\tWayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 74",

The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n\tThe apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\n\t• Armor Class: 20\n\t• Hit Points: 200\n\t• Speed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\n\t• Damage Immunities: poison, psychic\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\tThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\tA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.\n\nApparatus of Kwalish Levers:\nLever | Up | Down\n1 | Up:  Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim. | Down:  Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus's speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed.\n2 | Up:  Forward window shutter opens. | Down:  Forward window shutter closes.\n3 | Up:  Side window shutters open (two per side). | Down:  Side window shutters close (two per side).\n4 | Up:  Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus. | Down:  The claws retract.\n5 | Up:  Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. | Down:  Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 15).\n6 | Up:  The apparatus walks or swims forward. | Down:  The apparatus walks or swims backward.\n7 | Up:  The apparatus turns 90 degrees left. | Down:  The apparatus turns 90 degrees right.\n8 | Up:  Eyelike fixtures emit bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. | Down:  The light turns off.\n9 | Up:  The apparatus sinks as much as 20 feet in liquid. | Down:  The apparatus rises up to 20 feet in liquid.\n10 | Up:  The rear hatch unseals and opens. | Down:  The rear hatch closes and seals.\n\nFound on: Magic Item Table I\nSource:\tDungeon Master's Guide (2014) p. 151",

        "description": "Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.\nVenturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.\n\tArmed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.\n\tLater, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.\n\nMagic Weapon: The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of sharpness.\n\nRandom Properties: The axe has the following randomly determined properties:\n\n\t• 2 minor beneficial properties\n\t• 1 major beneficial property\n\t• 2 minor detrimental properties\n\nBlessings of Moradin: If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:\n\n\t• You have immunity to poison damage.\n\t• The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.\n\t• You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.\n\nConjure Earth Elemental: If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.\n\nTravel the Depths: You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.\n\nCurse: The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell.\n\nDestroying the Axe: The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.\n\nThrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.\n\nRange: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.\n\nVersatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.\n\nProficiency: martial, battleaxe\nSource:\tDungeon Master's Guide (2014) p. 221",

If you are a bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and choose to make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical darkness. Casting dispel magic on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours.\n\tThe instrument regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nIf you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus, substituting it for any material component that does not list a cost. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.\n\tProficiency with a musical instrument indicates you are familiar with the techniques used to play it. You also have knowledge of some songs commonly performed with that instrument.\n\nHistory: Your expertise aids you in recalling lore related to your instrument.\n\nPerformance: Your ability to put on a good show is improved when you incorporate an instrument into your act.\n\nCompose a Tune: As part of a long rest, you can compose a new tune and lyrics for your instrument.
