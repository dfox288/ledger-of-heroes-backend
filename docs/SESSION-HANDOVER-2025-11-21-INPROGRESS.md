## ✅ Completed This Session (continued)

### BATCH 2.1: Add spells_known Column (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ✅ All tests passing, committed

**What's Done:**
- ✅ Created test file: `tests/Feature/Migrations/ClassLevelProgressionSpellsKnownTest.php`
  - 2 test methods
  - Tests column existence and nullable constraint
- ✅ Ran failing test (RED phase - confirmed tests fail correctly)
- ✅ Created migration: `2025_11_20_083334_add_spells_known_to_class_level_progression.php`
- ✅ Ran migration successfully
- ✅ Ran passing test (GREEN phase - confirmed migration works)
- ✅ Ran full test suite (428 tests passing, 2,736 assertions)
- ✅ Ran Pint (code formatting clean)
- ✅ Committed changes (commit: d5db981)

### BATCH 2.2: Update Parser to Extract spells_known (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ✅ All tests passing, committed

**What's Done:**
- ✅ Created test file: `tests/Unit/Parsers/ClassXmlParserSpellsKnownTest.php`
  - 3 comprehensive parser unit tests (12 assertions)
  - Tests merging spells_known with slots
  - Tests exclusion from counters array
  - Tests spells_known without slots
- ✅ Ran failing tests (RED phase - confirmed correct failure)
- ✅ Updated `ClassXmlParser::parseSpellSlots()` to extract spells_known from counters
- ✅ Updated `ClassXmlParser::parseCounters()` to filter out "Spells Known" counters
- ✅ Ran passing tests (GREEN phase - 3 tests, 12 assertions)
- ✅ Ran full test suite (431 tests passing, 2,748 assertions)
- ✅ Ran Pint (code formatting clean, 1 style fix)
- ✅ Committed changes (commit: c0e7c8c)

**Key Implementation:**
- Parser extracts "Spells Known" from `<counter>` elements
- Merges into spell_progression array alongside spell slots
- Handles 3 cases: slots+spells_known, only spells_known, only slots
- Separates presentation (counters) from domain (progression)

### BATCH 2.3: Update Importer to Save spells_known (COMPLETE)
**Status:** ✅ All tests passing, committed

**What's Done:**
- ✅ Added test method to `ClassImporterTest`: `it_imports_spells_known_into_spell_progression()`
  - Uses Bard class (known-spells caster)
  - 10 assertions covering levels 1, 5, 10
  - Verifies spells_known saves correctly
  - Verifies "Spells Known" counters excluded
- ✅ Ran failing test (RED phase - spells_known was null)
- ✅ Updated `ClassImporter::importSpellProgression()` to save spells_known field
- ✅ Added spells_known to `ClassLevelProgression` model fillable array
- ✅ Added spells_known to `ClassLevelProgression` model casts array
- ✅ Ran passing test (GREEN phase - 1 test, 10 assertions)
- ✅ Ran full test suite (432 tests passing, 2,758 assertions)
- ✅ Ran Pint (code formatting clean)
- ✅ Committed changes (commit: 5292a32)

**Key Implementation:**
- Importer now saves spells_known from parsed data
- Model configured for mass assignment (fillable)
- Model configured for type casting (integer)
- Complete data flow: XML → Parser → Importer → Model → Database

## 🎯 Next Steps to Continue

### Resume at BATCH 2.4: Data Migration (60 minutes estimated)

**Goal:** Reimport all 42 class XML files to populate spells_known data in existing classes.

**Steps:**
1. Fresh database with migrations and seeders
2. Reimport all class files (includes classes with spells_known like Bard, Ranger, etc.)
3. Write verification tests to ensure data migrated correctly
4. Verify spells_known populated for known-spells casters
5. Run full test suite
6. Commit

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Bard levels 1-20 have spells_known populated
- Ranger (Natural Explorer variant) has spells_known
- Eldritch Knight (Fighter subclass) has spells_known for levels 3+
- Arcane Trickster (Rogue subclass) has spells_known for levels 3+
- All other casters remain unchanged (prepared casters don't track spells_known)

**Commands:**
```bash
# Fresh database
docker compose exec php php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Import all class files
docker compose exec php bash -c 'for file in import-files/class-*.xml; do php artisan import:classes "$file"; done'

# Verify imports
docker compose exec php php artisan tinker
# >>> CharacterClass::where('name', 'Bard')->first()->levelProgression()->count()
# >>> CharacterClass::where('name', 'Bard')->first()->levelProgression()->where('level', 1)->first()->spells_known
```

**Reference Implementation Plan:**
See `docs/plans/2025-11-20-class-importer-enhancements.md` - BATCH 2.4

## 🔍 Key Insights From Investigation

### Modifiers in Features Discovery
We found that class features DO contain modifier elements! Examples:
- **Barbarian Primal Champion:** `strength +4`, `constitution +4`
- **Monk Unarmored Movement:** Multiple `speed` bonuses
- **Ranger:** `speed +5`
- **Sidekick Warrior:** `AC +1`

**Decision:** This is a real feature but would expand scope significantly. Documented for future enhancement to stay on timeline for current priorities (Spells Known + Proficiency Choices).

**Future Work:** Create BATCH for parsing feature modifiers:
- Add `modifiers` JSON column to `class_features` table
- Update parser to extract modifiers from features
- Update API to expose feature modifiers
- Estimated effort: 2-3 hours
