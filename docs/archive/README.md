# Documentation Archive

This directory contains completed session handovers and implementation plans that are no longer actively referenced.

## Directory Structure

- **`handovers/`** - Completed session handover documents from previous work sessions
- **`plans/`** - Completed implementation plans and design documents

## Why Archive?

Documentation is archived when:
1. The feature/improvement is complete and merged
2. The implementation details are no longer needed for day-to-day development
3. The information is preserved for historical reference but clutters the main docs

## Active Documentation

For current documentation, see:
- `../PROJECT-STATUS.md` - Current project status and metrics
- `../README.md` - Main documentation index
- `../plans/` - Active implementation plans
- `../CLAUDE.md` - Developer guidance (main reference)
