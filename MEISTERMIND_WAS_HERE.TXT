In realms of code where dragons dwell,
And spellbooks parse their ancient spell,
A Laravel forge of JSON bright,
Transforms XML to REST's pure light.

Through Docker's depths, the data flows,
From Compendium where knowledge grows,
Each monster stat, each magic word,
In Meilisearch precisely stored.

The Classes train, the Items gleam,
While PHPUnit guards the dream,
With TDD as sacred creed,
We test before we write and read.

From Spell to Race, from Feat to Lore,
Nineteen importers at the core,
Sixteen parsers, trait by trait,
Transform the rules that heroes fate.

So here I stood, MeisterMind bold,
And watched this tale of code unfold,
A RESTful quest for those who seek,
The D&D data, strong and sleek.

🎲 May your endpoints never fail,
And your migrations always sail.
